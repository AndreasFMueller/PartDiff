Consider the partial differential equation
\[
u\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}
-
u\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}
=
0
\]
on the domain
$\Omega = \{(x,y)\in\mathbb R^2 \,|\, y < x\}$.
Find a solution that satisfies the boundary condition $u(x,y) = \sin x$ on
$\partial\Omega$.

\begin{loesung}
This is a quasidifferential equation of first order which can be solved
using the method of characteristics.
The ordinary differential equations
\[
\left.
\begin{aligned}
\dot{x}&=u\\
\dot{y}&=-u\\
\dot{u}&=0
\end{aligned}
\right\}
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
x(t)&=u_0t+x_0\\
y(t)&=-u_0t+y_0\\
u(t)&=u_0
\end{aligned}
\right.
\]
The boundary of the domain $\Omega$ is the straight line $y=x$, so it
can be parametrized by $x_0$ and $y_0=x_0$.
\begin{figure}

\caption{Domain $\Omega$ for the differential equation in
problem~\ref{30000018}.
The boundary of the domain is the straight line $y=x$ depicted in green.
The red lines are projections onto the domain of characteristics
emanating from the boundary.
\label{30000018:domain}}
\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{30000018:domain} shows the domain and the characteristics
emanating from the boundary.
The boundary condition is $u_0=u(x_0,y_0)=\sin x_0$, which leads to 
the system of equations
\begin{align*}
x &= t \sin x_0 + x_0\\
y &= -t \sin x_0 + x_0\\
u &= \sin x_0
\end{align*}
The sum of the first two equations is
\[
x_0 = \frac12(x+y).
\]
This allows to eliminate the variable $x_0$.

The difference of the first two equations is
\[
x-y=2t\sin x_0 = 2t\sin{\textstyle\frac12}(x+y)
\qquad\Rightarrow\qquad
t
=
\frac{x-y}2\cdot\frac1{\sin x_0}
=
\frac{x-y}2 \cdot\frac1{\sin\frac12(x+y)}.
\]
This would allow us to eliminate $t$, if need be.
However, there is no need for that because $t$
does not show up on the right hand side of the equation for $u$.

Substituting $\sin x_0$ in the last equation equation gives the solution
\[
u(x,y) = \sin{\textstyle\frac12}(x+y).
\]

To verify this solution, we first check that
$
u(x_0,y_0)
=
u(x_0,x_0)
=
\sin{\textstyle\frac12}(x_0+x_0)
=
\sin x_0$,
so it satisfies the boundary condition.
The partial derivatives of $u(x,y)$ are
\[
\left.
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}
&=
\frac12\cos{\textstyle\frac12}(x+y)
\\
\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}
&=
\frac12\cos{\textstyle\frac12}(x+y)
\end{aligned}
\right\}
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
u\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}-u\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}
=
u\cdot
\biggl(
\underbrace{
\frac12\cos{\textstyle\frac12}(x+y)
-
\frac12\cos{\textstyle\frac12}(x+y)
}_{\displaystyle=0}
\biggr)
=
0,
\]
so the differential equation also holds.
