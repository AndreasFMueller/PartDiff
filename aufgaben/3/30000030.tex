Find solutions that satisfy the boundary conditions found in
problem~\ref{30000029}.

\begin{hinweis}
For $y$ and $u$, try to find an equation for $\ddot{y}$. 
Use $\cosh'=\sinh$ and $\sinh'=\cosh$.
\end{hinweis}

\begin{loesung}
The first equation $\dot{x}=x$ has the exponential function $x(t)=Ce^t$
as a solution, the boundary condition $x(0)=Ce^0 = 1$ implies $C=1$, so
$x(t)=e^t$.

The other two equations can be reduced to a second order differential
equation by differentiating once more:
\[
\ddot{y}=\dot{u}=y
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
\ddot{u}=\dot{y}=u.
\]
Each of these equations has a linear combination of $\sinh t$ and $\cosh t$
as the solution.
Assuming $y(t) = A\cosh t + B \sinh t$, the initial condition $y(0)=y_0$
implies $A=y_0$.
Then the derivative ist $u=\dot{y}=y_0\sinh t+B\cosh t$, which has
boundary condition $\sin y_0 = u(0) = B$.
So the solutions are
\begin{align*}
x(t) &= e^t \\
y(t) &= y_0 \cosh t + \sin y_0 \sinh t \\
u(t) &= \sin y_0 \cosh t + y_0 \sinh t
\qedhere
\end{align*}
