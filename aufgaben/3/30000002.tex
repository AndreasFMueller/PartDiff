Consider the Cauchy problem for the partial diffrential equation
\begin{equation}
y\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+x\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}=0
\label{30000002:1}
\end{equation}
with boundary conditions $u(0,y)=y^2$.
It could be considered on the domain
$\Omega_+=\{ (x,y)\in\mathbb R^2\,|\, x > 0\}$
or on the domain
$\Omega_-=\{(x,y)\in\mathbb R^2\,|\, x <0\}$,
both wit a boundary condition specified on the $y$-axis.
But solutions on those domains can be stitched together to give a solution
in all of $\mathbb R^2=\overline{\Omega_+\cup\Omega_-}$ with the single
boundary data along the $y$-axis.
It thus makes sense to talk about a solution of 
\eqref{30000006:1} in the domain $\Omega=\mathbb R^2$.
\begin{teilaufgaben}
\item
Find the characteristics.
\item
Which part of the $x$-$y$-plane is covered by characteristics that emanate
from the $y$-axis?
\item
Solve the Cauchy problem.
Verify your solution by substituting into the partial differential equation
\eqref{30000002:1}.
\item
Consider the function
\[
v(x,y)=\begin{cases}
u(x,y)&\qquad |y|\ge |x|\\
(x^2-y^2)^2&\qquad |y|<|x|.
\end{cases}
\]
Obviously, $u(x,y)$ and $v(x,y)$ are different, e.~g.~$u(1,0)=-1$
and $v(1,0)=1$.
Verify that the function $v(x,y)$ also is a solution of the partial
differential equation which is different from $u(x,y)$.
Is it a solution?
\end{teilaufgaben}

\begin{loesung}
The boundary condition in this problem is specified on the $y$-axis.
To prevent confusions, we will such an boundary point by $y_0$, similar
to what we did in problem \ref{30000001}.
The method of characteristics will find functions $x(y_0,t)$,
$y(y_0,t)$ and $u(y_0,t)$ such that the partial differential equation
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\dot x(y_0, t)&=y\\
\dot y(y_0, t)&=x\\
\dot u(y_0, t)&=0
\end{aligned}
\label{30000002:chareq}
\end{equation}
is satisfied with boundary conditions
\begin{align*}
x(y_0, 0)&=0\\
y(y_0, 0)&=y_0\\
u(y_0, 0)&=f(y_0),
\end{align*}
where $f(y_0)$ gives the Cauchy boundary values along the $y$-axis.
\begin{teilaufgaben}
\item
From equation \eqref{30000002:chareq} we can read off that the characteristics
are all parallel to the $x$-$y$-plane.
Thus to find the characteristics, we can solve the equations for $x$ and $y$
independently of $u$.

Deriving the first equation and substituting it in the second equation
gives the ordinary differential equation
\[
\ddot x(t)=x(t)
\]
with solutions
$x(t)=a\cosh t$ and $x(t)=b\sinh t$.
We are looking for curves that emanate from points $(0,y_0)$ from
the $y$-axis, we have to take the $\sinh$-function for the solution,
giving
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
x(t)\\y(t)
\end{pmatrix}
=
y_0
\begin{pmatrix}
\sinh t\\
\cosh t
\end{pmatrix}.
\]
This function satisfies the equation $y^2-x^2=y_0^2$, it thus
parameterices hyperbolas through the points $(0,y_0)$.
\item
The solution curves are hyperbolas with asymptotes $y=\pm x$,
the characteristics cannot cross the asymptotes, so only the part
$\{(x,y)\in\mathbb R^2\;|\;|x|<|y|\}$ of the $x$-$y$-plane is covered by these
characteristics.
\item
The equation for $u$ gives $u(y_0, t)=y_0^2$.
The second step in the method of characteristics requires that the
variables $t$ and $y_0$ be eliminated from the equations
\begin{align*}
x&=y_0\sinh t\\
y&=y_0\cosh t\\
u&=y_0^2.
\end{align*}
For the hyperbolic functions we have
\[
y^2-x^2=y_0^2(\cosh^2t-\sinh^2t)=y_0^2.
\]
Substituting this in the third equation gives the solution
\[
u(x,y)=y^2-x^2.
\]
In fact, by computing the derivatives, we get
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}&=-2x\\
\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}&=2y\\
\Rightarrow
y\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+x\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}&=-2xy+2xy=0,
\end{align*}
so the differential equation is satisfied.

The Cauchy initial curve (green) does not uniquely determine the solution,
as the characteristics (red) do not cover the complete domain.

\item
The deriviatives for $|x|>|y|$ are
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}
&=2(x^2-y^2)2x\\
\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}
&=2(x^2-y^2)(-2y)
\end{align*}
This implies
\[
y\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}
+
x \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}
=
4xy(x^2-y^2)
-4xy(x^2-y^2)=0,
\]
so $v$ satisifies the partial differential equation.
In spite of this, $v$ is not a solution, because the pieces do not
fit together diffrentiably along the  lines $y=\pm x$.
On the line $x=y$, we have
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(y^2-x^2)&=-2x\\
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(x^2-y^2)^2&=2(x^2-y^2)2x=0.
\end{align*}
In particular, for $x>0$, the derivatives are different.
\end{teilaufgaben}

One can easily construct many different solutions for this equation
(see figure~\ref{30000002:solutionfigure}).
Let $f$ and $g$ be differentiable functions with $f(0)=g(0)$
and $f'(0)=g'(0)=0$, and consider the function
\[
u(x,y)=\begin{cases}
f(y^2-x^2)&\qquad |y|\ge|x|\\
g(x^2-y^2)&\qquad |y|\le|x|.
\end{cases}
\]
The values fit together along $|x|=|y|$, because then $x^2-y^2=0$,
i.~e.~$f(y^2-x^2)=f(0)=g(0)=g(x^2-y^2)$, so it does not matter which
definition we choose.
This even is true for the derivatives:
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}f(y^2-x^2)&=-2xf'(y^2-x^2)=-2xf'(0)=0
\\
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}g(x^2-y^2)&=2xg'(y^2-x^2)=2xg'(0)=0
\\
\frac{\partial}{\partial y}f(y^2-x^2)&=2yf'(y^2-x^2)=2yf'(0)=0
\\
\frac{\partial}{\partial y}g(x^2-y^2)&=-2yg'(y^2-x^2)=-2yg'(0)=0
\end{align*}
This means that $u$ is continuously differentiable.
Substituting it into the differential equation gives
\[
y\partial_xu+x\partial_yu
=
\begin{cases}
-yf'(y^2-x^2)2x+xf'(y^2-x^2)2y=0&\qquad |y|>|x|\\
yg'(x^2-y^2)2x-xg'(x^2-y^2)2y=0&\qquad |y|<|x|,
\end{cases}
\]
which means it is a solution.
It satisfies the boundary condition $u(0,y)=f(y^2)$ for every function $g$.
By choosing different functions $g$ subject to the conditions noted,
we can construct arbitrarily many solutions.

The reason for this is of course that the characteristics emanating from
the $y$-axis cover only the domain with $|y|> |x|$.
The part $|y|<|x|$ is ``invisible'' to these characteristics.
