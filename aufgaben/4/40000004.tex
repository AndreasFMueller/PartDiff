Solve the wave equation
\[
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2}=\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}
\]
for a string mounted between $x=0$ ynd $x=\pi$, which at time $t=0$
is in the rest position but has velocity
\[
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}(0, x)
=
\sin^3 x=\frac34\sin x-\frac14\sin 3x.
\]

This problem can also be solved using the transformation method, see
problem~\ref{50000004}.
\end{hinweis}

\begin{loesung}
Substituting the separation ansatz 
$u(t,x)=T(t)X(x)$ in the original equation gives the two equations
\[
X''(x)=-\mu X(x)\qquad\text{und}\qquad T''(t)=-\mu T(t),
\]
which have solution functions
\[
\begin{aligned}
X(x)&=\sin\sqrt{\mu}x & T(t)&=\sin\sqrt{\mu}t\\
X(x)&=\cos\sqrt{\mu}x & T(t)&=\cos\sqrt{\mu}t,
\end{aligned}
\]
where $\mu$ must be a positive number.

The boundary conditions for $x=0$ and $x=\pi$ can only be satisfied for
the functions $\sin\sqrt{\mu}x$ and also only if $\sqrt{\mu}$ is an
integer.
The general solution of the equation therefore has the form
\[
u(t,x)
=
\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n\sin nx \sin nt+\sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n\sin nx\cos nt
\]
The coefficients $a_n$ and $b_n$ still need to be determined using the
boundary condition for $t=0$.
We have
\begin{align*}
u(0,x)&=
\sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n\sin nx
\\
&=0\quad\Rightarrow\quad b_n=0
\\
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}(0,x)
&=
\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_nn\sin nx
\\
&=
\sin^3 x=\frac34\sin x-\frac14\sin 3x.
\end{align*}
It follows by comparing coefficients that
\begin{align*}
a_1&=\frac34\\
a_3&=-\frac{1}{12}\\
a_k&=0\qquad\text{for $k\ne 1,3$.}
\end{align*}
Thus the differential equation has the solution
\[
u(t,x)
= \frac34\sin x \sin t -\frac1{12}\sin 3x \sin 3t.
