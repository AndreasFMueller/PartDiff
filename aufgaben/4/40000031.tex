The separation of the equation in problem~\ref{40000030} gave the
separated equation
\begin{align*}
X'(x) &=\mu X(x)
&
Y'(y) &=\frac{\lambda}{\mu} Y(y).
\end{align*}
Find its solutions and verify that $u(x,y)= X(x)Y(y)$ is a solution
of the original equation.

\begin{loesung}
The equations have the general solutions
\begin{align*}
X(x) &= Ce^{\mu x}
&
Y(y) &= De^{\frac{\lambda}{\mu}y}.
\end{align*}
The product is $u(x,y)=X(x)Y(y) = CD e^{\mu x + \lambda y/\mu}$, which
has derivatives
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}
&=
CD \mu e^{\mu x+\lambda y /\mu}
\\
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y\partial x}
&=
CD \mu \frac{\lambda}{\mu} e^{\mu x+\lambda y /\mu}
=
\lambda CD e^{\mu x + \lambda y/\mu}
=
\lambda u(x,y),
\end{align*}
proving that $u(x,y)$ is an solution.
