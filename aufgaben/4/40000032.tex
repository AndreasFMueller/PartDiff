Find the values $\lambda$ for which there are solutions of the differential
equation
\[
X''(x)= -\lambda^2 X(x)
\]
on the domain $\Omega = (0,1)$ with homogeneous boundary conditions.

\begin{loesung}
The solutions are lineare combinations of trigonometric functions
\[
X(x) = A \cos\lambda x + B \sin\lambda x.
\]
Homogeneous boundary conditions imply at $x=0$ that
$X(0)=A=0$, so only sine functions are possible. 
In order to get a nontrivial solution, we need $B\ne 0$.
At the right end of the interval we have
\[
B \sin (\lambda\cdot 1) = 0,
\]
this equation only is true only if the argument $\lambda$ is an integer
multiple of $pi$, as these are the zeros of the sine function,
i.~e.~$\lambda = k\pi$ for $k\in\mathbb{Z}$.
