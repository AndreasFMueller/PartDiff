Use the Laplace transform to reduce the partial differential equation
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\cot x}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}
+
\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}
=
0
\label{50000024:eqn}
\end{equation}
on the domain
\begin{equation}
\Omega
=
\biggl\{
(x,y)\;\bigg|\; \frac12<x<1, y>0
\biggr\}
\label{50000024:domain}
\end{equation}
with boundary conditions
\begin{equation}
\left.
\begin{aligned}
u(x,0) &= 1 &&\text{for} & \frac12<\mathstrut&x<1
\\
u(1,y) &=e^{-y}&&\text{for}  & 0<\mathstrut&y
\end{aligned}
\quad
\right\}
\label{50000024:boundary}
\end{equation}
to a family of ordinary differential equations with suitable boundary
conditions.
Do the boundary conditions \eqref{50000024:boundary} uniquely determine
the solution?

\begin{loesung}
Only the $y$ variable is unbounded in the given domain
\eqref{50000024:domain}, so that is the variable to transform.
Applying the Laplace transform to the variable $y$ in the differential
equation~\eqref{50000024:eqn}, we get the equation
\[
\tan x \frac{\partial }{\partial x}
(\mathscr{L}u)(x,s)
+
s(\mathscr{L}u)(x,s)
-
\underbrace{u(x,0)}_{\displaystyle=1}
=0.
\]
The second boundary condition needs also be transformed, it gives
\[
(\mathscr{L}u)(1,s)
=
(\mathscr{L}e^{-y})(s)
=
\frac{1}{1+s}.
\]
If we write $y_s(x)=(\mathscr{L}u)(x,s)$ and consider $s$ as a simple
parameter, we get the ordinary differential equation
\begin{equation}
\tan(x)
\cdot
y'_s(x) 
+sy_s(x)
=
1
\end{equation}
in the interval $x\in(\frac12,1)$ with initial conditions
\[
y_s(1)
=
\frac{1}{1+s}.
\]
The differential equation has well-behaved coefficients in all of the
domain which implies that there is a unique solution for $y_s(x)$.
This in turn implies that the solution to the original problem, if it
exists, must be unique.
