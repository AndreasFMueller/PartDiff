The ordinary differential equation $y'+ay=b$ with initial conditions
$y(0)=c$ has the general solution
\[
y(x) = \biggl(c-\frac{b}{a}\biggr)e^{-ax} + \frac{b}{a}.
\]

\item
The Laplace transform of the differential equation
\eqref{50000013:dgl}
is
\begin{align*}
s^4 {\cal L}u(x,s)
-s^3 u(x,0)
-s^2\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}(x,0)
-s\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2}(x,0)
-\frac{\partial^3 u}{\partial t^3}(x,0)
+
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}{\cal L}u(x,s)
&=
0.
\end{align*}
The boundary conditions say that the second and fourth terms vanish
and that the fifth term is $=1$.
The differential equation thus becomes
\begin{align*}
s^4 {\cal L}u(x,s)
-1
+
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}{\cal L}u(x,s)
&=
0
\\
\Rightarrow\qquad
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}{\cal L}u(x,s)
+
s^4 {\cal L}u(x,s)
&=
1.
\end{align*}
This a family of first order ordinary differential equations
paramterized by $s$ for the function $\mathscr{L}u(x,s)$.

The initial conditions for this differential equation can be obtained
by taking the Laplace transform of the boundary condition
$u(0,t)=e^{-t}$.
The Laplace transform of the function $e^{-t}$ is
\[
\mathscr{L}u(0,s) = \frac1{s+1}.
\]

The differential equation becomes a little more clear if we write
$y_s(x) = \mathscr{L}u(x,s)$ because then it becomes
\begin{equation}
y_s'(x) + s^4 y_s(x)=1
\qquad\text{with initial conditions}\qquad
y_s(0)=\frac1{s+1}.
\label{50000013:final}
\end{equation}

\item
The differential equation \eqref{50000013:final} is a differential equation
of the kind described in the hint with $a=s^4$, $b=1$ and $c=1/(s+1)$.
The solution is
\[
{\cal L}u(x,s)
=
y_s(x)
=
\biggl(\frac1{s+1}-\frac1{s^4}\biggr)e^{-s^4x} + \frac{1}{s^4}.
