\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}

\[
\begin{aligned}

u\biggl(x,\phantom{-}\frac{\pi}2\biggr) &= 2-e^{-x}Â &&\text{for}&x&>0\\
u(0,y)                                  &= 1        &&\text{for}&y&\in\biggl(-\frac{\pi}2,\frac{\pi}2\biggr).

Use the Laplace transform to convert the partial differential equation
into a family of ordinary differential equations that can be used to
find solutions for the differential equation.
\item
Are the given boundary conditions sufficient to solve the equation?
What additional boundary conditions must be specififed for the
method to work?

\item
The Laplace transform of the differential equation with respect to
the variable $x$ is
\[
s^2 (\mathscr{L}u)(s,y)
-
s
\underbrace{u(0,y)}_{\displaystyle=1}
-
\underbrace{\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}(0,y)}_{\displaystyle=g(y)}
+
s (\mathscr{L}u)(s,y)
-
\underbrace{u(0,y)}_{\displaystyle=1}
=
(1+y^2)\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}
\mathscr{L}u(s,y).
\]
Writing $f_s(y) = \mathscr{L}u(s,y)$, this is a parametrized
family of ordinary differential equations
\begin{equation*}
(s^2+s) f_s(y) - g(y) - (s+1) = (1+y^2)f_s''(y)
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
f_s''(y) - \frac{s+s^2}{1+y^2}f_s(y)
=
-
\frac{1+s+g(y)}{1+y^2}.
\end{equation*}
The boundary conditions for $y=\pm\frac{\pi}2$ also need to be 
transformed:
\[
\begin{aligned}
f_s\biggl(-\frac{\pi}2\biggr)
&=
\mathscr{L}u\biggl(s,-\frac{\pi}2\biggr) = \frac{1}{s+1},
\\
f_s\biggl(\frac{\pi}2\biggr)
&=
\mathscr{L}u\biggl(s,\frac{\pi}2\biggr)
=
\frac{2}{s} - \frac{1}{s+1}.
\end{aligned}
\]
\item
The method needs the function
\[
g(y) = \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}(0,y)
\]
in addition to the boundary conditions given in the problem.
This is in line with the intuition that second order equations 
need two initial conditions for the initial value and the initial
derivative.
