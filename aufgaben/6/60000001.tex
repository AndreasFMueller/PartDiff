\item
This is a partial differential equation of third order, so it des
not fit into the classification scheme.
\item
This is the partial differential equation
\[
\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2}-\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}=0,
\]
the coefficient matrix of the second derivatives is
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
1&0\\0&-1
\end{pmatrix},
\]
which has two eigenvalues with different signs.
Thus this equation is hyperbolic.
\item
The symbol matrix is
\[
A=\begin{pmatrix}
1&2\\2&1
\end{pmatrix}.
\]
The eigenvalues can be found using the characteristic equation:
\begin{align*}
\det(A-\lambda E)
&=
\left|\begin{matrix} 1-\lambda&2\\2&1-\lambda\end{matrix}\right|
\\
&=(1-\lambda)^2-4\\
&=\lambda^2-2\lambda-3=0,
\end{align*}
which has zeros
$\lambda_1=3$ and $\lambda_2=-1$.
In particular, the equation is hyperbolic.
\item
In this case the characteristic polynomial is the same as in the
previous subproblem, so this equation is hyperbolic as well.
\item
The symbol matrix
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
1&-\frac12\\
-\frac12&1
\end{pmatrix}
\]
has the characteristic polynomial
\[
(1-\lambda)^2-\frac14=\lambda^2-2\lambda-\frac34
\]
with zeros
$\lambda_1=\frac32$ and $\lambda_2=\frac12$,
thus it is elliptic.
\item
After moving all terms to one side we get the differential equation
\[
\partial_1^2u+\dots\partial_n^2u-\kappa\partial_t^2u=0
\]
with symbol matrix
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
1&0&\dots&0\\
0&1&\dots&0\\
\vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\
0&0&\dots&-\kappa\\
\end{pmatrix},
\]
which is hyperbolic for
$\kappa > 0$ and elliptic for $\kappa < 0$.
For $\kappa=0$ the equation is parabolic.
