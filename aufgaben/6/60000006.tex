Find a particular solution for the equation
\[
\Delta u = x^2 + y^2
\]
on the domain $\Omega = \{(x,y)\mid -1<x<1\wedge -1< y< 1\}$.

\begin{loesung}
The Laplace operator differentiates the particular solution $u_p(x,y)$
and leads to a sum of polynomial in $x$ and $y$.
Integrating each polynomial twice with respect to the independent
variable gives suitable polynomials:
\[
u_p(x,y)
=
\frac{x^4}{3\cdot 4}
+
\frac{y^4}{3\cdot 4}.
\]
In fact, applying the Laplace operator gives
\[
\Delta u_p
=
\frac{1}{3\cdot 4}
\biggl(
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}
+
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}
\biggr)
(x^4+y^4)
=
\frac{1}{3}
\biggl(
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}
x^3
+
\frac{\partial}{\partial y}
y^3
\biggr)
=
x^2+y^2,
\]
showing that $u_p(x,y)$ is in fact a particular solution.
