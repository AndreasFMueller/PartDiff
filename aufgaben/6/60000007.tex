Use the particular solution found in problem~\ref{60000006}
to turn the nonhomogeneous partial differential equation
\[
\Delta u = x^2 + y^2
\]
on the domain $\Omega=\{(x,y)\mid x^2+y^2<1\}$ with homogeneous
Dirichlet boundary conditions into a homogenous problem.

\begin{loesung}
Look for a solution in the form $u=u_r+u_p$ and substitute this ansatz
into the differntial equation, giving
\[
x^2+y^2
=
\Delta u 
=
\Delta (u_r+u_p)
=
\Delta u_r + \underbrace{\Delta u_p}_{\displaystyle \clap{$x^2+y^2$}}
\qquad\Rightarrow\qquad
\Delta u_r = 0.
\]
So $u_r$ ist the solution of a homogeneous equation, but we still need
to specify the boundary conditions.
The original problem had homogenous boundary values, i.~e.~$u = 0$
on $\partial\Omega$, so $u_r = -u_p$ on $\partial\Omega$.
But $u_p = 1/12$ on $\partial\Omega$, so the new boundary condition
for $u_r$ becomes
\[
u_r = -\frac1{12}
\qquad\text{on $\partial\Omega$}.
\qedhere
