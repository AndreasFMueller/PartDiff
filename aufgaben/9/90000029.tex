Find the differential equation for the characteristics of the
partial differential equation
\[
x\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}
-\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x\,\partial y}
+
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}
=
0.
\]

\begin{loesung}
The symbol matrix is
\[
A
=
\begin{pmatrix}
a&b\\
b&c
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
x&-\frac12\\
-\frac12&1
\end{pmatrix}.
\]
The differential equation for the characteristics becomes
\begin{align*}
x\, \dot{y}(s)^2 - 2\biggl(-\frac12\biggr) \dot{x}(s)\dot{y}(s) + \dot{x}(s)^2
&=
0
\\
x\dot{y}(s)^2 +\dot{x}(s)\dot{y}(s) +\dot{x}(s)^2 &=0.
\end{align*}
Note the coefficient $x$ of the second derivative with respect to $x$
in the partial differential equation shows up as a coefficient to
$\dot{y}^2(s)$ in the equation for the characteristics.
