The equation for the characteristics for the partial differential
equation of problem~\ref{90000029} was found to be
\begin{equation}
x\,\dot{y}(s)^2 + \dot{x}(s)\dot{y}(s) + \dot{x}(s)^2 = 0.
\label{90000030:fig}
\end{equation}
Convert this into an ordinary differential equation for the function $y(x)$.

\begin{loesung}
Such an equation is obtained by dividing the equation~\ref{90000030:fig}
by $\dot{x}(s)^2$
giving
\begin{align*}
x\, \frac{\dot{y}(s)^2}{\dot{x}(s)^2}
+
\frac{\dot{y}(s)}{\dot{x}(s)}
+
1
&=
0,
\intertext{and using $y' = \dot{y}(s)/\dot{x}(s)$, leading to the equation}
x(y')^2 + y' + 1&=0
\end{align*}
This is a quadratic first order differential equation.
