Find the differential equation for the characteristics for the
partial differential equation
\[
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x\,\partial y} = p(x,y).
\]

\begin{loesung}
The symbol matrix and the coefficients therein are

\[
A
=
\begin{pmatrix}
0&\frac12\\
\frac12&0
\end{pmatrix}
\qquad\Rightarrow\qquad
a = c =0,\; b =\frac12.
\]
Putting that into the differential equation gives
\[
-2\cdot\frac12\dot{x}\dot{y} = -\dot{x}\dot{y}= 0.
\]
This equation means that either $\dot{x}=0$ or $\dot{y}=0$,
which is equivalent to characteristic curves being coordinate lines.
