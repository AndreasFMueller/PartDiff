Consider the partial differential operator
\begin{equation}
L
=
-y
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}
-
(1-y)
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x\,\partial y}
+
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}
\label{90000020:operator}
\end{equation}
in the domain $\Omega=\{(x,y)\in\mathbb R^2\;|\; y > e^{-x}\}$.
\begin{teilaufgaben}
\item
Is the operator $L$ elliptic, parabolic or hyperbolic?
\item
If $L$ is elliptic, find a solution of $Lu=1$ with boundary $u=0$
on $\partial\Omega$.
\item
If $L$ is parabolic, find the arrow of time.
\item
If $L$ is hyperbolic, determine the characteristics of $L$.
Do the characteristics intersect the boundary of $\Omega$ in precisely
one point?

\caption{Characteristics of the hyperbolic differential operator 
\eqref{90000020:operator}.
Characteristics $y=-x+C$ with $C>1$ are shown in green, 
characteristics $y=\sqrt{2x+D}$ are shown in red.
The green characteristics intersect the boundary twice.

\item
The symbol matrix is
\[
A
=
\begin{pmatrix}
-y&\frac12(y-1)\\
\frac12(y-1)&1
\end{pmatrix}
\qquad\Rightarrow\qquad
\det A
=
-y -\frac14(y-1)^2
\]
Since $y>0$ in $\Omega$, the determinant is always negative,
implying that $L$ is hyperbolic.
\item
$L$ is not elliptic.
\item
$L$ is not parabolic.
\item
The equation for the characteristics is
\begin{align*}
-y \dot{y}^2 -(y-1)\dot{x}\dot{y} +\dot{x}^2 &= 0
\\
\Rightarrow\qquad
-y y'^2 - (y-1) y' + 1 &= 0.
\end{align*}
We have to solve this quadratic equation for $y'$ to get easier to
solve differential equations for $y$:
\begin{align*}
y'
&=
\frac{y-1}{-2y} \pm \sqrt{\frac{(y-1)^2}{4y^2}+y}
=
\frac{1-y}{2y} \pm \sqrt{\frac{y^2-2y +1-4y}{4y^2}}
=
\frac{1-y}{2y} \pm \sqrt{\frac{y^2+2y +1}{4y^2}}
\\
&=
\frac{1-y}{2y} \pm \frac{1+y}{2y}
=
\begin{cases}
\displaystyle\frac1y&Â \\[5pt]
-1&
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
So we have to solve the two differential equations
\begin{align*}
y'&=-1 &&\text{and}& y'&=\frac{1}{y}
\intertext{with solutions}
y&=-x+C &&\text{and}& 2yy' &= 2
\\
 &      &&          &   y^2&= 2x + D
\\
 &      &&          &   y  &= \sqrt{2x + D}
\end{align*}
The characteristics are thus straight lines of slope $-1$ and 
shifted root curves.

Note that the square root curves are only defined for $x>-D/2$
Not every parameter value is possible for $C$.
The boundary curve intersects the $y$-axis with slope $-1$ and
because the second derivative of the boundary curve is positive,
the domain $\Omega$ is always entirely above that tangent line in
any point of the boundary.
$C$ is the intercept of the characteristic $y=-x+C$, thus $C=1$ is
the smallest acceptable value for $C$ is $1$.

We have to find out whether the characteristics intersect the boundary 
precisely once.
The root curves are always monotonously increasing, while the boundary
curve is montonously decreasing.
Thus the can only intersect exactly once.

Whatever the value of $C$, the characteristic always intersects
the $x$-axis at $x=-C$.
Since the boundary of the domain lies above the $x$-axis, it must
intersect the characteristic at some $x<C$.
Similarly, the boundary curve increases exponentially as $x\to-\infty$,
while the characteristic only increases linearly.
Thus there must be an intersection point with negative $x$.
This means that every $-x+C$ characteristics intersects the boundary
twice except when $C=1$, when it intersects precisely once.
