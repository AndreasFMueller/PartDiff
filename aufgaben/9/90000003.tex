Show that the partial differential equation
\[
\partial_x\partial_y u=0
\]
on the domain $\Omega=\mathbb R^2$ is hyperbolic.
Find the characteristics.

\begin{loesung}
The symbol matrix is
\[
A=\begin{pmatrix}0&\frac12\\\frac12&0\end{pmatrix}.
\]
$A$ has the characteristic polynomial
$\lambda^2-\frac14=(\lambda-\frac12)(\lambda+\frac12)$
with zeros
$\pm\frac12$.
This proves that the equation is hyperbolic.

The differential equation for the characterstics is
\[
\dot x\dot y=0,
\]
so $\dot x=0$ or $\dot y=0$.
Therefore the characteristic curves are parallel to the coordinate
axes.

Alternatively we can find the characteristics as follows:
The directions of the characteristics are those vectors $v$ that make
the expression $v^tAv$ vanish.
If we write the vector $v$ as
\[
v=\begin{pmatrix}v_1\\v_2\end{pmatrix},
\]
then the components of $v$ must satisfy the equation
\[
v^tAv=v_1v_2=0,
\]
i.~e.~$v_1=0$ or $v_2=0$.
The characteristics therefore are parallel to the coordinate axes.
