Find all solutions of the wave equation
\[
\partial_t^2u-a^2\partial_x^2u=0
\]
in the half plane $x>0$ with initial values
\[
u(0,x)=0,\quad x>0
\]
and boundary conditions
\[
u(t,0)=\sin t,\quad t\in\mathbb R.
\]

\begin{hinweis}
There are infinitely many solutions.

\begin{loesung}
In the lectures the d'Alembert solution of the wave equation was
presented.
It represents the general solution of the wave equation in the form
\begin{equation}
u(t,x)
=
u_+(x+at)+u_-(x-at),
\label{90000004:dalembert}
\end{equation}
where the functions $u_+$ and $u_-$
need to be determined from boundary conditions.
It is clear that the functions can be completely different to the left
and the right of $0$.

The function $u_+(x+at)$ describes a wave travelling to the left.
The part for negative arguments cannot influence the solution for $x>0$,
so we may arbitrarily set $u_+(x)=0$ for $x<0$.

The initial condition for $t=0$ implies that
\[
u_+(x)+u_-(x)=0
\]
for $x>0$.
Thus we may use
\[
u_+(x)=\begin{cases}u_0(x)&\qquad x\ge 0\\
0&\qquad x<0,
\end{cases}
\]
where $u_0$ is an arbitrary function.
The function $u_-$ must now be chosen in such a way that the
all the boundary conditions hold for the 
combined solution \eqref{90000004:dalembert}:
\[
u_-(x)=\begin{cases}
-u_0(x)&\qquad x\ge 0\\
?&\qquad x<0.
\end{cases}
\]
The missing part of the function $u_-$ must be defined such that the
second boundary condition is satisfied.
This requires
\[
u_+(at)+u_-(-at)=\sin t.
\]
Writing 
$at=y$ or $t=\frac{y}{a}$
this condition defines the missing part of the definition of $u_-$
for positive $t$:
\[
u_-(-y)=-u_+(y)+\sin \frac{y}{a}
\]
or
\[
u_-(y)=\begin{cases}
-u_0(y)&\qquad y\ge 0\\
-u_0(-y)-\sin{\displaystyle\frac{y}{a}}&\qquad y<0
\end{cases}
\qedhere
