The Dirac-$\delta$-function has the property that
\[
\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(y)\delta(x-y)\,dy = f(x).
\]
Suppose there is a function $g(x)$ such that $g''(x)=\delta(x)$.
Verify formally (without worrying about convergence of integrals, e.~g.)
that the function
\[
u_p(x)
=
\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(y)g(x-y)\,dy
\]
is a particular solution of the equation $u''=f$.

\begin{loesung}
By moving the differentiation into the integral we get from the
definition of the function $u_p$ the equation
\begin{align*}
u_p''(x)
&=
\frac{d^2}{dx^2}
\int_{-\infty}^\infty
f(y)
g(x-y)
\,dy
=
\int_{-\infty}^\infty
f(y) g''(x-y)\,dy
=
\int_{-\infty}^\infty
f(y) \delta(x-y)\,dy.
\intertext{Now applying the definition of $\delta$-function gives}
&=
g(x).
\qedhere
\end{align*}
