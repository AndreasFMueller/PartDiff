The operator $\Delta = \partial^2/\partial x^2$ is an elliptic operator on the
domain $\Omega = (0,1)$.
Find the general solution of the homogeneous equation, $\Delta u=0$,
and convince yourself that such a solution cannot have an extremum
in the domain unless it is constant.

\begin{loesung}
Since the second derivative is $0$, the function $u$ must be linear,
i.~e.~of the form $u(x)=ax+b$.
To find an extremum, take the derivative $u'(x)=a$.
This vanishes only if $a=0$.
This allows us to conclude that either $u$ has no extrema, for $a\ne 0$,
or alternatively, $u$ ist constant, for $u=0$.
