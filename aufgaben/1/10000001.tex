Let $f(x)$ be a twice continuously differentiable function on $\mathbb R$.
Check that the functions
\[
u_+(t,x)=f(x+at)
\qquad
\text{and}
\qquad
u_-(t,x)=f(x-at)
\]
are solutions of the wave equation
\[
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}=\frac1{a^2}\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2}.
\]

\begin{loesung}
We need the partial derivatives of each of the functions
$f(x\pm at)$, which we compute as follows:
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}u_{\pm}(t,x)
&=f'(x\pm at)
\\
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}u_{\pm}(t,x)
&=f''(x\pm at)
\\
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}u_{\pm}(t,x)
&=\pm af'(x\pm at)
\\
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}u_{\pm}(t,x)
&=a^2f''(x\pm at).
\end{align*}
Substituting that into the wave equation gives
\[
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}u_{\pm}(t,x)
-\frac1{a^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}u_{\pm}(t,x)
=f''(x\pm at)
-\frac1{a^2} a^2f''(x\pm at)=0,
\]
thus the functions $u_{\pm}(t,x)$ are both solutions of the
wave equation.
