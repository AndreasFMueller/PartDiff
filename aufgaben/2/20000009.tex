Which of the following sets is open, i.~e.~a domain?
Also identify the boundary points.
\begin{teilaufgaben}
\item $A = \{x\in \mathbb{R} \mid 1<x<2\}$
\item $B = \{x\in \mathbb{R} \mid 1<x\le 2\}$
\item $C = \{x\in \mathbb{R} \mid x^2 < 1\}$
\item $D = \{x^2\mid x \in \mathbb{R} \wedge x < 1\}$
\end{teilaufgaben}

\begin{loesung}
\begin{teilaufgaben}
\item
$A$ is the open intervall between $1$ and $2$, it does not contain
the end points and thus with every point there is a small neighborhood
contained in $A$.
\item
$B$ is $A$ with the point $2$ added.
This point does not have a neighborhood completely contained within $B$,
as every such neighborhood contains real numbers $>2$ which are not in $A$.
Thus $B$ is not open.
\item
$C$ ist the open intervall $(-1,1)$, this similarly to a), it is open
and has boundary points $\pm 1$.
\item
Since the condition in the definition of $D$ allows for all negative
real numbers, their squares are nonnegative and thus
$D$ contains all nonegative numbers.
So $D=\{x\in \mathbb{R}\mid x\ge 0\}=[0,\infty)$.
The point $0$ is a boundary point contained in $D$, $D$ cannot be open
as every neighborhood of the point $0$ contains negative numbers
which are not contained in $D$.
So $D$ is not open.
