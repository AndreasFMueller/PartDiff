Find the function $F$ that describes the following differential
expressions:
\[
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_1}
-
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_2}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_3},
\qquad
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_1}
-
\frac{\partial }{\partial x_2}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_3},
\qquad
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_1}
-
x_2
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_3},
\]
Which ones are linear?

\item
We need variables that stand for the derivatives of $u$
with respect to $x_1$, $x_2$ und $x_3$.
We use $p_1$, $p_2$ and $p_3$ for that and get the function
$F(p_1,p_2,p_3)=p_1-p_2p_3$.
In fact
\[
F\biggl(
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_1},
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_2},
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_3}
\biggr)
=
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_1}
-
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_2}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_3}
\]
This expression is not linear, as it involves the product $p_2p_3$.
\item We need variables for the first order derivative of $u$ with
respect to $x_1$, which we call $p_1$, and for the second order
derivative with respect to $x_2$ and $x_3$, which we call $t_{23}$.
Then we can use the function $F(p_1,t_{23}) = p_1-t_{23}$.
In fact
\[
F\biggl(
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_1},
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x_2\partial x_3}
\biggr)
=
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_1}
-
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x_2\partial x_3}
=
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_1}
-
\frac{\partial}{\partial x_2}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_3}.
\]
This expression is linear.
\item
We need variables for the first order derivatives of $u$ with
respect to $x_1$ and $x_3$, which we call $p_1$ und $p_3$.
In addition, the function $F$ depends on $x_2$, as it appears as a
variable in the expression.
Then we can use $F(x_2,p_1,p_3)=p_1-x_2p_3)$.
In fact
\[
F\biggl(
x_2,
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_1},
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_3}
\biggr)
=
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_1}
-
x_2
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_3}.
\]
This expression is linear.
