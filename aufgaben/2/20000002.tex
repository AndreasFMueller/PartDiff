Which of the following sets are domains?
\begin{teilaufgaben}
\item $\Omega=\{(x,y)\in\mathbb R^2\,|\, \text{$x$ has a real square root}\}$
\item $\Omega=\{(x,y)\in\mathbb R^2\,|\, x^2+y^2>0\}$.
\end{teilaufgaben}

\item
Precisely the numbers
$x\ge 0$ have a real square root, so $\Omega$ is the set
\[
\Omega=\{(x,y)\in\mathbb R^2\,|\, x\ge 0\}.
\]
This is a half plane that includes the $y$-axis.
The points on the $y$-axis are boundary points, any small neighborhood of
these points has points in $\Omega$ and points outside of it.
So $\Omega$ is not open and therefore not a domain.
(figure \ref{20000002:fig} left).
\item
$\Omega$ consists of all points except the origin.
If $r$ is the distance of the point $(x,y)$ from $(0,0)$, then every
Ball
$B((x,y),r)$ is contained in $\Omega$, so $\Omega$ is open and therefore
a domain.
(figure \ref{20000002:fig} right).

The boundary of $\Omega$ is just the point $(0,0)$, adding this point
to $\Omega$ turns it into the plane which again is a domain.
This may be surprising at first because the common intuition is that
by adding the boundary to a domain makes it not a domain.
This indicates that one always has to go back to the definition
that domains need to be open sets.
