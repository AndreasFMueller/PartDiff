A plane cartesian coordinate system is given.
The circle $\Omega$ is centred at its origin $(0,0)$ and has a radius of
$r = 5$.  
The function $u(x,y)$ is defined on the circle 
$\Omega$. 

\bigskip

The function $u(x,y)$ satisfies in $\Omega$ Poissons's equation
\[
\Delta u(x,y) + x \cdot y = 0
\]
and on the boundary of $\Omega$ the Dirichlet condition $u(x,y) = 0.$

\bigskip
Determine approximate values for $u$ in the four points of $\Omega$ 
\[
(3,3), \quad
(-3,3), \quad
(-3,-3), \quad
(3,-3)
\]
by the method of finite differences. 


\begin{loesung}
Set
$\tilde u_1 = \tilde u(3,3),
\tilde u_2 = \tilde u(-3,3),
\tilde u_3 = \tilde u(-3,-3),
\tilde u_4 = \tilde u(3,-3)$
as well as
\[
A
=
\left[
\begin{array}{rrrr}
-14 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & -14 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & -14 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 1 & -14
\end{array}
\right]
\quad \text{and} \quad
\underline{b}
=
\left(
\begin{array}{r}
-189 \\
 189 \\
-189 \\
 189
\end{array}
\right).
\]
Then 
\[
A \cdot \underline{\tilde u} = \underline{b}.
\]
Therefore $\underline{\tilde u} = ( 189/16, -189/16, 189/16, -189/16)$.
