The real function $u(x)$ is defined on the interval
\[
\Omega = [0, 1].
\]
The function satisfies in $\Omega$ the differential equation
\[
u''(x) + 2 = 0
\]
and on the boundary of $\Omega$  the conditions
\[
u(0) = 1, \quad u(1) = 1.
\]
Determine an approximation function $\tilde u(x)$ for $u(x)$.

Apply the finite element method.

Use the meshes
\[
[0,0.25], \quad
[0.25, 0.75], \quad
[0.75, 1]
\]
and linear shape functions.

\begin{loesung}
Set
\[
\underline{\tilde u} \approx (u(1/4), u(3/4))
\]
as well as 
\[
A
=
\left[\begin{array}{rr} -6 & 2 \\
2 & -6
\end{array}\right]
\quad \text{and} \quad
\underline{b}
=
\left(\begin{array}{r} -3/4-4 \\
-3/4-4 \end{array}\right).
\]
Then
\[
A \cdot \underline{\tilde u} = \underline{b}.
\]
Therefore
\[
\underline{\tilde u} = (19/16, 19/16).
\]
