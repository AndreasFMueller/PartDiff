A plane cartesian coordinate system is given.
The function $u(x,t)$ is defined on the strip 
\[
\Omega = [0, 4] \times [0,\infty)
\]
The function $u(x,t)$ satisfies in $\Omega$ the heat equation
\[
u_{t}(x,t) = u_{xx}(x,t)
\]
and on the boundary of $\Omega$ the conditions 
\[
u(0,t) = u(4,t) = 0
\]
as well as
\[
u(x,0) = 4 \cdot x - x^2.
\]

Determine approximate values for $u$ in the three points for
$\Omega$
\[
(1,2), \quad  (2,2), \quad (3,2)
\]
by the Richardson method with 
\[
\Delta x = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad  \Delta t = 1.
\]

\begin{loesung}
One has
\[
\tilde u(1,0) = 3,\quad \tilde u(2,0) = 4,\quad \tilde u(3,0) = 3.
\]
Since $r = 1$ one has
\[
\underline{\tilde u}^{n+1}
=
C \cdot \underline{\tilde u}^{n}
\]
with
\[
C = \left[\begin{array}{rrr} -1 & 1 & 0  \\ 1 & -1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & -1 \end{array}\right].
\]
Therefore
\[
\tilde u(1,2) = 1, \tilde u(2,2) = 0, \tilde u(3,2) = 1.
\qedhere
