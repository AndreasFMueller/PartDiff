The function $u(x,t)$ is defined on the strip 
\[
\Omega = [0, \pi] \times [0,\infty).
\]
The function $u(x,t)$ satisfies in $\Omega$ the wave equation
\[
u_{xx}(x,t) = u_{tt}(x,t)
\]
and on the boundary of $\Omega$ the conditions 
\[
u(0,t) = u(\pi,t) = 0
\]
as well as
\[
u(x,0) = \sin(x)^4
\qquad\mbox{and} \qquad
u_t(x,0) = \sin(x)^2.
\]

Determine approximate values for $u$ in the three points for $\Omega$
\[
(\pi/4,2), \qquad
(\pi/2,2), \qquad
(3 \cdot \pi/4,2)
\]
by the method of finite differences. Use the leapfrog method with 
\[
\Delta x = \pi/4 \quad \text{and} \quad  \Delta t = 1.
\]

\begin{loesung}
One has
\[
\tilde u(\pi/4,0) = 1/4,
\tilde u(\pi/2,0) = 1,
\tilde u(3 \cdot \pi/4,0) = 1/4
\]
and
\[
\tilde u(\pi/4,1) = 7/4,\quad
\tilde u(\pi/2,1) = 0,\quad
\tilde u(3 \cdot \pi/4,1) = 7/4.
\]
With $r = 4/\pi$ one has
\[
\tilde u(x, 2)
=
r^2 \cdot \tilde u(x - \pi/4, 1)
+ 2 \cdot (1 - r^2) \cdot \tilde u(x,1) + r^2 \cdot \tilde u(x + \pi/4, 1)
- \tilde u(x,0).
\]
Therefore
\[
\tilde u(\pi/4,2) = -2.424,\quad
\tilde u(\pi/2,2) = 4.674,\quad
\tilde u(3 \cdot \pi/4,2) = -2.424.
\]
