The real function $u(x)$ is defined on the interval
\[
\Omega = [0, 1].
\]
The function satisfies in $\Omega$ the differential equation
\[
u''(x) + x = 0
\]
and on the boundary of $\Omega$  the conditions
\[
u(0) = 0, \quad u(1) = 0.
\]
Determine an approximation function $\tilde u(x)$ for $u(x)$.

Apply a) the method of Galerkin and b) the method of Gauss. 

\begin{loesung}
Use in a) and b) the same ansatz
\[
u(x) = a \cdot (x - x^2).
\]
a) One has
\[
\int_0^1 (a \cdot (x - x^2)'' + x) \cdot (x - x^2) \ dx = 0.
\]
Therefore $a = 1/4$ and
\[
u(x) = (x - x^2)/4.
\]
b) One has
\[
\frac{d}{da} \int_0^1 (a \cdot (x - x^2)'' + x)^2 \ dx = 0.
\]
Therefore $a = 1/4$ and
\[
u(x) = (x - x^2)/4.
\qedhere
