\lhead{Transformation}
The Laplace transform famously provides a very successful method
to solve initial value problems for ordinary linear differential equations.
On the other hand, our most successful methods to solve partial differential
equations have always reduced the problem to ordinary differential
equations and solved them.
So there is some hope that a suitable extension of the method of the
Laplace transform should also help us solve partial differential
equations.
This chapter shows how integral transforms like the Laplace transform,
Fourier transform or Fourier series can be made useful in solving
partial differential equations.

\section{Summary}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
The transform from functions to Fourier series converts
partial derivatives into algebraic terms and partial differential
equations into ordinary differential equations for the
fourier coefficients.
\item
Integral transforms have the potential of converting partial differential
equations into a family of partial differential equations with fewer
variables or ordinary differential equations.
\item
Integral transforms and reverse transforms can deliver formulae for the
solutions of partial differential equations and in addition answer
the question for which boundary conditions the problem is well posed.
\end{enumerate}
