\section{Plate equation}
Still a bit more complicated is the equation of motion for a plate.
\index{plate}
Again, a plate is different from a membrane in that it resists bending
even if not under tension.
If $w(x,y)$ is the deviation of a plate from its shape at point $(x,y)$,
we get the differential equation
\[
D\left(
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial^2 x}
+
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial^2 y}
\right)
\left(
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial^2 x}
+
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial^2 y}
\right)
w(x,y)
=D\Delta\Delta w(x,y)
=p(x,y)
\]
for the static deformation of the plate under load.
$D$ is again some material constant and $p(x,y)$ is the pressure at
$(x,y)$ on the plate.

The double Laplacian $\Delta\Delta$ is not a typo, the plate equation
is a fourth order partial differential equation just like the beam
equation~\eqref{examples:beam-equation}.
