\label{chapter:examples}}
\lhead{Introductory examples}
In this chapter we present a few partial differential equations
of prime practical importance which will also serve us as case
studies to illustrate general theorems and solution techniques.
The examples illustrate
\begin{enumerate}
\item
the manifold applications of the theory of partial differential equations,
\item
three completely different cases that lead to incompatible solution
algorithms and
\item
the importance of boundary and initial conditions.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Summary\label{examples:summary}}
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
Partial differential equations appear in physics whenever fields need
to be described: waves, pressure, temperature, velocity, potential,
electric field,\dots
\item
The Laplace-Operator seems to be ubiquitous in these equations.
\end{enumerate}
