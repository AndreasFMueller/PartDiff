\section{Heat equation}
The heat equation is a prototype for a so called parabolic differential
equation.
Such equations are also used to describe diffusion processes.
The Schr√∂dinger equation, the basis of quantum mechanics, is also of this type.

We derive the heat equation for the one dimensional case.
We examine a rod of length $l$ between $x$-coordinates $0$ and $l$
and strive to compute the temperature distribution $T(x,t)$ for 
$0<x<l$ and for all times $t>0$.
We need the initial temperature distribution, which we call
$T(x,0) = f(x)$.
We expect to solve this problem using a partial differential equation.

The heat that flows in a time interval $\Delta t$ through the rod at
coordinate $x$ is proportional to the temperature gradient at that point.
The amount of heat flowing into the section  of the rod between
$x$ and $x+\Delta x$ is therefore proprtional to
\[
\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}(x+\Delta x)-\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}(x).
\]
This additional heat lets the temperature if the segment rise, depending
on the heat capacity of the material.
The volume of the segment is $\Delta x$, the temperature change is smaller
when the volume is larger.
It becomes
\[
\Delta T
=
\kappa
\frac{1}{\Delta x}
\biggl(
\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}(x+\Delta x)-\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}(x).
\biggr) \Delta t.
\]
Dividing by $\Delta t$ and going to the limits $\Delta t\to 0$
and $\Delta x\to 0$ leads to
\[
\lim_{\Delta t\to 0}\frac{\Delta T}{\Delta t}
=
\frac{\partial T}{\partial t}
=
\kappa
\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac1{\Delta x}\left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}(x+\Delta x)-\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}(x)\right)
=\kappa\frac{\partial^2T}{\partial x^2}.
\]

Again we have to specify suitable initial and boundary conditions.
As initial condition we already have found
\[
T(x,0)=f(x)\qquad \forall x\in[0,l].
\]
As a boundary condition at the end of the rod we could prescribe the
temperature.
In physics terms this means that both ends of the rod are in contact
with a heat reservoir at constant temperature.
If we prescribe the derivatives of $T$ with respect to $x$ at $x=0$ and
$x=l$, we fix the flow of heat into the rod.
In particular, requiring
\[
\frac{\partial T}{\partial x} = 0
\]
means that no heat flows through the ends of the rod, the rod is
thermally isolated from its environment.
