\chapter{Hyperbolic functions}
The standard method to solve linear differential equations with constant
coefficients usually give oscillatory solutions or exponentially
decaying or increasing solutions.
The integration constants then have to be determined from the initial
conditions.
For oscillatory solutions this is most of the time very simple because
the two basic solutions $\sin x$ and $\cos x$ have very special 
initial values.
For exponential functions $e^x$ and $e^{-x}$ this is much more
complicated.
In this appendix we show that using hyperbolic functions, we can
get the same ease as with trigonometric functions for exponential
solutions.
