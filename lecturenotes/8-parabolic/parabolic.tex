\rhead{}
In the previous chapter we were able to develop a formula for the
solution of an elliptic boundary value problem using Green's 
function.
This method depended in an essential way on the maximum principle.
It guarantees the uniqueness of solutions and thus allowed the
construction of Green's function in the first place.

For parabolic differential equations a similar technique is
available.
However, the time coordinate, i.~e.~the coordinate with 
the zero eigenvalue of the symbol matrix, will always have to be
treated specially.
We just summarize the main ideas in the first three sections
without proofs or deeper analysis.

In contrast to elliptic equations, the heat equation can also be
considered as a ``equation of motion'' for the temperature distribution
just like the ordinary differential equation $\dot x=f(x,t)$ is an
equation of motion for the state vector $x$.
The domain of the heat equation is typically of the form
$\Omega\times(0,\infty)$, where $\Omega$ is a domain in space.
The solution of the heat equation is a function in $\Omega$ with 
an additional time dependency, which we can express using a
separation ansatz.
It turns out that this allows the solution of the heat equation
by using the already established solution of the elliptic problem.
