Lighting a vibrating string with a stroboscope at the frequency of the
string makes the string seemingly stand still (see figure
\ref{separation:schwingendesaite})
The shape of the solution of the wave equation thus is the same
at periodically recurring points in time.
Measuring the elongation's dependence on time, it turns out to be
a harmonic oscillation which can be described using sine and cosine
functions.
This leads to the conjecture that the solution can be written as 
a product
\[
u(x,t)=X(x)\cdot\sin\omega t\quad\text{oder}\quad X(x)\cdot\cos\omega t.
\]
The goal of this chapter is to develop this idea into a solution
algorithm that is applicable to a suitably large class of partial
differential equations.

\section{Summary}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Using a suitable {\em ansatz}, a partial differential equation can be
decomposed into a set of coupled ordinary differential equations.
\item
The choice of ansatz is essential predicated on the geometry of the
domain, in particular on the coordinate system and the type of equation.
\item
For linear partial differential equations, the partial solutions found
by the previous steps can be linearly combined to give more solutions
of the initial partial differential equation.
\item
The central idea of the method is that an equation where one side
depends only on $x$ and the other side only on $y$ can only be constant.
\item
In the case of partial differential equations of second order,
which can very often be treated using a product ansatz, the separation
usually leads to an eigenvalue problem with fewer variables.
