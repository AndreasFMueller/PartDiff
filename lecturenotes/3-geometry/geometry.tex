The direction field of an ordinary differential equation is a very
\index{direction field}
convenient way to build an intuition about the solutions of an equation
(figure~\ref{geometrie:ode}).
The solution curve is tangent to directions specified by the differential
equation.


The solution of a partial differential equation with two independent
variables, which is the situation we will restrict ourselves to in
this chapter, can be visualized as a surface.
Is there a concept similar to the direction field of an ordinary
differential equation that helps us visualize the solutions?
The first idea that comes to mind is a field of tangent planes.
\index{tangent plane}
Such a field would fix the first derivatives individually.
What a partial differential equation does, however, is to only fix an
often linear combination of first derivatives.
We have to accept a more complicated answer.

\section{Summary}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
The generalization of direction field from the theory of ordinary
differential equations is a sheaf of planes.
The graph of the solution function must have a tangent plane in the 
sheaf for every point.
\item
The planes of the sheaf have a common vector, called the axis of the sheaf,
or informally in these notes the ``red'' vector.
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
a(x,y,u)\\
b(x,y,u)\\
c(x,y,u)
\end{pmatrix}.
\]
Integral curves of this vector field are called characteristics
or informally ``red'' curves.
\item
The solution surface of a quasilinear partial differential equation
is covered by characteristics that all go through the initial curve
(informally the ``green'' curve).
\item
To find the solution function, eliminate the parameter of the initial
curve and the of the characteristics.
\item
Characteristics are those curves that are not suitable as initial
curves.
This characterization will become even more useful in
chapter~\ref{chapter:hyperbolic}.
\item
With the help of characteristics it is possible to decide which boundary
conditions are necessary in order for a problem to be well posed.
\end{enumerate}
